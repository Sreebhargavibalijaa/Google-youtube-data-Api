# Google-youtube-data-Api

• YouTube API is an application programming interface that allows you to embed videos, curate playlists, and offer other YouTube functionalities on your website
• I have added a python script to get all the video titles of particular channel using youtube api and then developed a plot between count of videos to the uploaded hour of a day.
